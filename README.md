# **Machine Learning Workflow For Scones Unlimited On Amazon SageMaker**
### **Background**
Image Classifiers are used in the field of computer vision to identify the content of an image and it is used across a broad variety of industries, from advanced technologies like autonomous vehicles and augmented reality, to eCommerce platforms, and even in diagnostic medicine.

As an MLE, my goal is to ship a scalable and safe model. Once the model becomes available to other teams on-demand, itâ€™s important that the model can scale to meet demand, and that safeguards are in place to monitor and control for drift or degraded performance.


#### **Project Steps Overview**
In this project:
* I will use AWS Sagemaker to build an image classification model that can tell bicycles apart from motorcycles. 
* Then deploy the model.
* Use AWS Lambda functions to build supporting services.
* Use AWS Step Functions to compose the model and services into an event-driven application
* At the end of this project, I will have created a portfolio-ready demo that showcases my ability to build and compose scalable, ML-enabled, AWS applications.
